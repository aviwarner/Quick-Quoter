# Quick Quoter

Quick Quoter is an in-progress Zendesk app that helps agents manage longer/more complex tickets. Easily save snippets from Requester or Agent comments, and then add them as quotes in the ticket editor with a single click of the button.

### How to use:

* Select any text on a ticket comment to add a snippet.
* Append a snippet to the ticket editor as a quote, or remove it.
* Quick Quoter keeps things cleaned and organized. On ticket submission, your snippet list is cleared out.
